                I am proficient in various tasks related to software development and infrastructure management. I enforce branching strategies like Gitflow to facilitate parallel development and release management. Additionally, I utilize AWS services such as AWS IAM, AWS KMS, and AWS Config to enable and regulate security and compliance controls on the AWS platform.

                To achieve end-to-end automation of software delivery, I incorporate CodePipeline along with other AWS services like AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CloudFormation. I also develop Terraform modules and AWS CloudFormation templates to define and deploy infrastructure resources, including compute instances, network resources, and storage.
                
                Ensuring code quality and adherence to coding standards is crucial. Therefore, I conduct code reviews and provide feedback to team members. Furthermore, I integrate code quality tools such as SonarQube and CodeQL into the CI/CD pipelines to maintain high code quality and prevent technical debt.
                
                Automation is a key aspect of my work. I create automation solutions using Ansible for provisioning IT infrastructure, configuration management, and application deployment. I also develop Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts to deploy applications to Kubernetes clusters. Additionally, I streamline Dockerfiles and Docker images to facilitate application deployment across different environments.
                
                Collaboration and observability are vital in a team environment. Thus, I work with development and operations teams to integrate PagerDuty with other enterprise systems, ensuring comprehensive incident observability. I am skilled in using Grafana for monitoring and visualizing various metrics and data sources.
                
                While Azure DevOps extensions and integrations are within my expertise, I am experienced in creating and managing pipelines using Azure DevOps for build, test, and deployment automation. In Jira, I design and configure workflows, screens, custom fields, and notifications to cater to the unique needs of different project teams. I also implement and maintain Jira plugins and add-ons to enhance productivity and collaboration.
                Security is a priority for me. I apply security measures and access controls in Confluence and Jira to safeguard sensitive data and comply with regulatory requirements. 
                
                
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
            <div class="about-wrapper__info">
              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                
                Additionally, I perform regular system maintenance, including upgrades, patches, and backups, to ensure optimal performance and availability of Confluence and Jira.
        
                Supporting Confluence and Jira users is part of my responsibilities. I deliver technical support, troubleshoot issues, and perform root cause analysis to ensure efficient system usage. Moreover, I create comprehensive documentation and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for Confluence and Jira administration to facilitate knowledge transfer and team training.
                I am also responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining data virtualization solutions using Denodo. These solutions integrate data from various sources and present it as a unified view. I collaborate with database administrators (DBAs) to integrate Denodo with relational databases like Oracle, SQL Server, and MySQL.

                In terms of AWS, I provide technical support and resolve issues related to AWS services. This includes troubleshooting and conducting root cause analysis. I also establish and strengthen high availability and disaster recovery solutions in AWS using services like AWS ELB and AWS RDS Multi-AZ.
                
                For AWS infrastructure management, I design and implement infrastructure as code using tools such as CloudFormation, Terraform, and AWS CDK. This allows for efficient provisioning and management of AWS resources. Additionally, I develop and maintain automated deployment pipelines utilizing AWS services like AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS Code.
                
                To ensure optimal performance and cost control, I manage and monitor various AWS services such as EC2, S3, RDS, and Lambda. This involves utilizing AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail for monitoring, performance optimization, and cost management.
                
                Furthermore, I troubleshoot and resolve issues related to Airflow tasks, connections, and configurations. I have experience in identifying and resolving any challenges that may arise in Airflow implementations.
                
                Overall, my expertise lies in designing and maintaining data virtualization solutions, integrating Denodo with relational databases, providing technical support for AWS services, establishing high availability and disaster recovery solutions in AWS, implementing infrastructure as code, managing and monitoring AWS services, and troubleshooting Airflow tasks and configurations.
